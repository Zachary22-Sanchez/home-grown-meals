<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>I would like my PWP to help me obtain the confidence I will need after this class by
	applying the knowledge I’ve learned so far into building something from scratch that
	can potentially be used by myself one day as my own business.</p>

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>Busy bodies to have zero time in their day to worry about cooking their own meals or
	having to take the time to go somewhere to pick something up.</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>To add to my gallery to showcase my work to eventually attract potential employers or clients. </p>

<h2>Name:</h2>

<h2>Frustrations and Needs:</h2>
<p>As mentioned John needs to be on the move constantly to make it to his next appointments with different
	clients. He likes to take advantage of pre-made meals he can order online and have delivered to his location.
	He finds when he has his meals prepared, he can grab and go. He has no time to cook for himself and ends up spending
	too much money eating out. He gets upset that the only options are generally greasy fast food locations.</p>

<h2>Goals:</h2>
<p>John’s goal is to have a quick site to access to be able to place an order for food. He hopes the site will have
	detailed descriptions of the various dishes available. As well as the cost on the food and delivery. </p>

<p>As a quick user, John wants to be able to access a site and place a food order.</p>
