## PWP Milestone 2 feedback
Content strategy is straighforward and to the point. You're have what is necessary for moving forward. A suggestion for you to consider is to stack the pictures of your meals so there won't be so much clutter when scrolling through that section on mobile. There are also many options out there on the web when it comes to using interactive galleries on your PWP. 

If you need additional resourcers for the development aspects of your project, feel free to reach out to the instructors so that we may guide you in the direction of some functionality you may be seeking. Continue on moving forward with the development of your PWP. Keep up the good work!
